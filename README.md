# Dataset-Bias-Investigation
Investigating dataset bias via Name the Dataset (Torralba &amp; Efros, CVPR 2011) and Name the Label, decomposing it into semantic and non-semantic components. Proposes two DANN variants, improving semantic accuracy by ~2% (ResNet-18) and ~0.5% (ViT-B/32); fortunately, the non-semantic component dominates in this setting.
