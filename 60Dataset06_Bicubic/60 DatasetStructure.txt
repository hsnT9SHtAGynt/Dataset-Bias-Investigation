Notes:

There is no NonSemanticTest/ in Dataset06. Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR-100 are fully merged into the unified label space defined by 05dataset_new_label_list.csv.

Class directories are named <new_label_id>_<new_label>.

2) Image pipeline
Tiny-ImageNet (original 64×64): downsample to 32×32 (bicubic) → upsample to 256×256 (bicubic).
Rationale: matches CIFAR’s 32×32 footprint before standardizing resolution.

CIFAR-100 (original 32×32): upsample to 256×256 (bicubic).

No random crops — every saved image is exactly 256×256.

File naming:

From Tiny-ImageNet: tiny_<original_stem>.jpg

From CIFAR train: cifar_tr_<index:05d>.jpg

From CIFAR test: cifar_te_<index:05d>.jpg

Random seed = 42 for a reproducible train/validation split.

3) Splits
All splits are built only from the classes listed in 05dataset_new_label_list.csv (the unified label list).
Some classes may come from only one source (e.g., Tiny only or CIFAR only) depending on that CSV; there is no separate “non-semantic” bucket.

Train / Validation:
For each unified class, take Tiny-ImageNet train + CIFAR-100 train, shuffle deterministically, then split 90% / 10% into train and validation.

Test:
For each unified class, combine all Tiny-ImageNet validation images with all CIFAR-100 test images.

4) Metadata file
metadata.csv
One row per saved image, with columns in this exact order:


image_id, filepath, new_label_id, new_label,
tiny_synset_id, tiny_synset_name,
cifar_fine_id, cifar_fine_name,
dataset_id, split
image_id = filename stem (e.g., tiny_XXXX, cifar_tr_00042, cifar_te_00123)

filepath = relative path under 60Dataset06_Bicubic/

new_label_id, new_label = the unified class ID/name from the CSV

tiny_synset_* / cifar_fine_* = original IDs/names from each dataset (may be empty for the dataset that doesn’t contribute images for that class)

dataset_id ∈ {TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100}

split ∈ {train, validation, test}

Dataset06 does not produce a Newmetadata.csv; metadata.csv covers the three splits (train/validation/test).

5) Statistics report
60 Num of origin for each class.txt summarizes per-class counts by split and source:


=== Split Statistics ===
Split: test
  goldfish (id=0): total=150, TI=50, CIF=100
  brown bear (id=1): total=150, TI=50, CIF=100
  …etc…
Split: train
  goldfish (id=0): total=1350, TI=1200, CIF=150
  …etc…
Split: validation
  goldfish (id=0): total=150, TI=135, CIF=15
  …etc…
Each line shows:

total images for that class in the split

TI = count sourced from Tiny-ImageNet

CIF = count sourced from CIFAR-100

That’s the full picture for Dataset06: a unified, bicubic-resized 256×256 dataset with consistent splits across the merged Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR-100 classes, clean metadata, and per-class origin counts — with no Non-Semantic Test split.
